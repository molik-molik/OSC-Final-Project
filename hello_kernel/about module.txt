The simplest possible module, let's take a closer look at the most important parts of it:

"Include" lists the header files required for Linux kernel development.

You can set different values in MODULE_LICENSE, depending on the license of the module. 

init (loading) and exit (unloading) as static functions that return integers.

At the end of the file, you can call module_init and module_exit and specify the upload and download functions. 
This allows arbitrary naming of functions.

Makefile is needed to compile this file. Run "make" to compile.

If we run make, it should compile our module successfully. The result will be the hello_kernel.ko file.
